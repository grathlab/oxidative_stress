   * Raw reads have been deposited in SRA under accession codes `x - x`. See manuscript for details.

* Gene expression data: 
    * `data/ALL_GCounts_M9sampleremoved.csv` - count table with expression data
    * `data/metadata.csv` - sample information
    
## Infomation on running scripts

* The R scripts should be run from the directory they are in. Output will be stored in created subfolders as the code is run. 
* The file session_info.txt gives information on version numbers of all packages and the platform for final analyses described in the manuscript.
